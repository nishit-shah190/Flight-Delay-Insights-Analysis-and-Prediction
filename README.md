# Flight Delay Insights: Analysis and Prediction
### Data and Business Analysis Report


## 1. Executive Summary

### Purpose of the Report
The primary objective of this analysis is to examine flight performance metrics, including delays, cancellations, and diversions, to identify patterns and key contributing factors. The goal is to derive insights that can:
- Improve operational efficiency
- Optimize resource allocation
- Enhance the overall passenger experience

### Recommendations
- **Operational Improvements**: Airlines should focus on reducing carrier-related delays by improving operational factors.
- **Weather Contingency Plans**: Enhanced weather forecasting models and proactive re-routing strategies can help minimize cancellations and diversions.

## 2. Introduction

### Scope of the Analysis
This analysis investigates the following metrics:
1. **Flight Delays**: Examining departure and arrival delays, their frequency, and contributing factors.
2. **Cancellations**: Identifying trends in flight cancellations and primary reasons behind them.
3. **Diversions**: Analyzing the frequency and causes of flight diversions.
4. **Flight Performance**: Evaluating scheduled vs actual elapsed time, taxi time, and air time to assess overall efficiency.
5. **Airline and Airport Comparison**: Assessing differences in performance across airlines and airports.

## 3. Data Preparation and Cleaning

### Data Cleaning Process
#### Data Import and Initial Exploration
- Imported the dataset into **Tableau** for visualization and **Python (Pandas)** for preprocessing.
- Conducted **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand the structure, identify missing values, and detect anomalies.

#### Handling Missing Values
- Identified missing values primarily in **weather-related delay columns**.
- Imputed missing values using **column median** where applicable or categorized them as "Unknown" for categorical fields.

#### Outlier Detection and Treatment
- Removed clear data-entry errors while retaining high-delay records relevant to the analysis.

#### Data Type Conversion
- Converted date columns to appropriate **datetime** format.
- Ensured numeric columns like **passenger count** were recognized correctly as integers or floats.

#### Standardizing and Normalizing Data
- Standardized categorical values for consistency (e.g., "NYC" and "New York" â†’ "New York, NY").
- Applied scaling to columns where necessary for meaningful comparisons.

#### Feature Engineering
- Derived new columns such as **"Flight Delay Category"** based on delay duration thresholds.
- Created **quarter-based time aggregation** to identify seasonal trends.

### Data Quality Assessment
- **Completeness**: Dataset was mostly complete except for some weather delay fields.
- **Consistency**: Standardized city names and ensured uniform time formats.
- **Accuracy**: Addressed anomalies in delay durations.
- **Limitations**:
  - Some assumptions were made while imputing missing weather delays.
  - Lack of granular data on security-related delays.
